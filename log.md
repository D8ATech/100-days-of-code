# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday Jan 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Pi Wizard single ROM download.  Listened to one chapter on the Linked In Leaning course JavaScript Essential Training

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with the training course because I am not connecting with the author.  I am going to switch to PluaralSite and FreeCodeCamp
to see if connect better with their delivery style.

### Day 2: Thursday Jan 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Worked on and completed Single Rom Download for Pi Wizard.  Listened to 4 chapters on LinkedIn Learning course JavaScript Essential Training

**Thoughts**
Bash scripting is incredibly frustrating at times.  I am sure that some would say that it is not programming but they can
kiss my ass.  It may not be Python or JavaScript but it is coding all the same
