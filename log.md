# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday Jan 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Pi Wizard single ROM download.  Listened to one chapter on the Linked In Leaning course JavaScript Essential Training

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with the training course because I am not connecting with the author.  I am going to switch to PluaralSite and FreeCodeCamp
to see if connect better with their delivery style.

**Link(s) to work**: [Pi Wizard](http://thepiwizard.com) - Launcher
